    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains the basics of the `JADE` code. It represents a practical guide, showing you how to get acquainted with the code. If you want to know more about the physics behind the model, you can refer to [Attia et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...647A..40A/abstract). If you make use of the `JADE` code for a scientific publication, please cite the latter article.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus here on the most fundamental level at which you can use the `JADE` code, namely **forward modeling** with a **single simulation at a time**. To employ the terminology of the `JADE` use cases (see [Attia et al. 2025]()), we will go through **FD1**, **FA1**, **FA3**, and **FC**. Their meaning will become clear as you progress in this tutorial."

    "## Basic usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `JADE` code is pretty straightforward. It follows the simple rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **One simulation = One input file**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, if you get familiar with input files, you are already halfway there. Several example input files are provided within the package, for the sake of the tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important element to note is that **all input files should always be located in the `input/` folder**. You can classify your input files in different folders (and even nested folders), but everything should be inside `input/`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure and contents of the input files are documented in the examples. **It is important to read the input documentation, all of it, before launching any simulation**. Until you get familiar with creating your own, you can duplicate the example input files that are the closest to your intended usage, and modify the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your input file, let us say `input/my_folder/my_simulation.txt`, you can launch the simulation by running `routines/main.py` with that file as an argument. Concretely, in a terminal, once you are in the `JADE` base folder, run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd routines\n",
    "    python main.py my_folder/my_simulation.txt\n",
    "    \n",
    "Do not add `input/` before the path to the input file, **said path should always be relative to `input/`**. As the simulation progresses, information will be printed by `JADE` on the terminal. If you want to save these information (the “log” of the simulation) in a file instead, you can redirect the terminal standard output:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python main.py my_folder/my_simulation.txt > path/to/my_simulation.log\n",
    "    \n",
    "*Note:* the simulation log is not the output that you will use for doing science. It is for information and housekeeping purposes only.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**The proper simulation output will always be located in the `saved_data/` folder, in the form of `.npz` files**. You can define a specific directory for your output (relative to `saved_data/`) in the input file, by setting the `output_dir` field. \n",
    "\n",
    "Good practice dictates consistency between your input/output directory structure. If we take our previous example input file `input/my_folder/my_simulation.txt`, the output directory should be set to `output_dir = my_folder/my_simulation`. This way, your output files will be located in `saved_data/my_folder/my_simulation/` and will be called `simulation_name_001.npz`, `simulation_name_002.npz`, etc, where \n",
    "- `simulation_name` is defined in the input file in the `name` field,\n",
    "- the number of `.npz` files is defined by `output_freq`, the saving frequency. For example, a value of `output_freq = 20` will save an `.npz` file every 20%, so you will have five of them. *Note:* this might differ if you resume a halted simulation using the `reuse` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.npz` files are the ones you would analyze for doing science. You can try to do it yourself by loading them using `numpy`, but there is a util `utils/output.py` that conveniently handles that for you, as we will see below. Once you get familiar with the outputs, nothing stands between you and unlocking the full potential of the `JADE` code."

    "## Use case FD1: Forward modeling, dynamics alone\n",
    "\n",
    "The most immediate use you can make of the `JADE` code is to simulate the dynamical evolution of a hierarchical three-body system. This corresponds to the **FD1** use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `JADE` code has been developed first and foremost for modeling such a configuration, in order to be able to monitor the evolution of a von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai (ZLK) resonance (see [von Zeipel 1910](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1910AN....183..345V/abstract), [Lidov 1962](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1962P%26SS....9..719L/abstract), [Kozai 1962](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1962AJ.....67..591K/abstract) for the historical publications, [Naoz 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ARA%26A..54..441N/abstract) for a comprehensive review, and [Attia et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...647A..40A/abstract) for its application to `JADE`). By saying hierarchical three-body system, we mean here two bodies (typically an inner planet and an outer perturber) orbiting a central one (typically a star) at semi-major axes $a$ and $a_{\\rm pert}$, such as $a_{\\rm pert} \\gg a$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us run a simulation featuring a **ZLK resonance counterbalanced by tidal effects**, which corresponds to a typical dynamical evolution you would want to model. An example input file is provided to this end: `input/examples/example_fd1.txt`. First, have a look at this file to assess its contents. In particular, you will see the following settings at the beginning of the file:\n",
    "- `dyn = True`: the dynamical integrator is turned on.\n",
    "- `perturber = True`: the action of the third body (perturber) is turned on.\n",
    "- `orderdyn = 4`: the secular equations of the perturber are truncated to the fourth (hexadecapolar) order. This is the highest order, you could also set `2` or `3`. The higher you go, the more accurate your dynamical evolution will be, but the slower the simulation will be. Physical differences related to using different orders can be found in, e.g., [Naoz (2016)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ARA%26A..54..441N/abstract).\n",
    "- `tides = True`: star–planet tidal dissipation is turned on.\n",
    "- `atmo = False`: the atmospheric structure/evaporation integrators are turned off.\n",
    "\n",
    "The temporal bounds of the simulation are set by these two parameters:\n",
    "- `t_init = 10.`: the simulation will start at $t_{\\rm i} = 10\\,{\\rm Myr}$, typical disk dispersal time.\n",
    "- `age = 100.`: the simulation will stop at $t_{\\rm f} = 100\\,{\\rm Myr}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further in the input file, you can see that we will model a Sun-like star, orbited by an initially circular warm mini-Neptune perturbed by an inclined, circular cold Jupiter-size planet:\n",
    "- `Ms = 1.` and `Rs = 1.`: the stellar mass and radius are $M_\\star = 1\\,M_\\odot$ and $R_\\star = 1\\,R_\\odot$.\n",
    "- `Mpl = 0.06` and `Rpl = 0.337`: the inner planet mass and radius are $M_{\\rm p} = 0.06\\,M_{\\rm J} \\simeq 19\\,M_\\oplus$ and $R_{\\rm p} = 0.337\\,R_{\\rm J} \\simeq 3.8\\,R_\\oplus$.\n",
    "- `Mpert = 1.`: the perturber mass is $M_{\\rm pert} = 1\\,M_{\\rm J}$. There is no perturber radius (point mass).\n",
    "- `planet_sma = 0.5`: the initial semi-major axis of the inner planet is $a(t = t_{\\rm i}) = 0.5\\,{\\rm AU}$.\n",
    "- `pert_sma = 10.`: the semi-major axis of the perturber is $a_{\\rm pert} = 10\\,{\\rm AU}$ (fixed). You can see that the hierarchical condition is satisfied (you will be fine as long as `pert_sma` $> 10\\,\\times$ `planet_sma`).\n",
    "- `planet_ecc = 0.00001`: the initial eccentricity of the inner planet is $e(t = t_{\\rm i}) = 10^{-5} \\simeq 0$ (not exactly set to zero for numerical reasons).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Important note on the mutual inclination:** you probably want to set an initial mutual inclination $i_{\\rm mut}(t = t_{\\rm i})$ that is high enough to trigger a ZLK resonance ($> 39.2^\\circ$ for circular orbits, e.g., [Kinoshita & Nakai 1999](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999CeMDA..75..125K/abstract)), and in general you probably want to have control over the initial mutual inclination. However, transforming it into the right initial orbital parameters defined at the end of the input file can be a real headache. Fortunately, by aligning the lines of nodes of the planet and perturber, as is done in the example, it becomes trivial. This is why\n",
    "- `planet_lambd = 0.` and `pert_lambd = 0.`: the mean longitudes are $\\lambda(t = t_{\\rm i}) = \\lambda_{\\rm pert} = 0^\\circ$,\n",

    "\n",
    "This configuration ensures that $i_{\\rm mut}(t = t_{\\rm i}) = \\lvert i(t = t_{\\rm i}) - i_{\\rm pert} \\rvert$, which allows you to set the initial mutual inclination directly from the orbital inclinations. In the example, as we have `planet_incl = 90.` and `pert_incl = 15.`, we hence get $i_{\\rm mut}(t = t_{\\rm i}) = 75^\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* this configuration also ensures that the initial argument of periastron of the inner planet is $\\omega(t = t_{\\rm i}) = 0^\\circ$, which is the locus of minimum eccentricity in a ZLK resonance (e.g., [Naoz 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ARA%26A..54..441N/abstract)), consistent with the initial circular orbit.\n",

Nonetheless, the `JADE` code self-consistently computes all the necessary quantities from the system properties, in a dynamical manner (using the formalism of [Salz et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...585L...2S/abstract)), which ensures a better agreement with observed mass-loss rates than a naive energy-limited approach.\n",

This will eventually result in a faster decoupling of the inner planet from the perturber, when the eccentricity amplitude cancels out (a phenomenon also first identified by `JADE` and well described in [Attia et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...647A..40A/abstract))."
